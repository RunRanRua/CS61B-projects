# CS61B: Data Structures - UC Berkeley

Welcome to my repository for the CS61B: Data Structures course offered by UC Berkeley. This repository contains all the projects and assignments I completed as part of my study to improve my understanding of data structures and enhance my programming skills.

## Projects

1. **Project 0 : 2048**
   - Description: Create a 2048 game with the structure and graphical interface already provided.
   - Objectif : Getting to grips with Java syntax
2. **Project 1a: [LinkedListDeque61B]**
   - Description: build your own versions of the list-like structure (Double Linked List with circular sentinel)
   - Topics Covered : List -> Node -> SLList (with `next`) -> SLList (sentinel) -> DLList (with `last`) -> DLList (double sentinels) -> DLList (circular sentinel).
3. **Project 1b: [ArrayDeque]**
   - Description: a different implementation of the Deque61B interface that uses a backing array, rather than linked nodes.
   - Topics Covered: backing array 
4. **Project 1c: [Deque enhancements]**
   - Description: based on the 2 previous deque, try to build a new better deque.
   - Topics Covered: iterator(), equals(), and toString()
5. **Project 2a: []**
